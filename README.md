# reof-mas-src
Reof-mas is an environment written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") where different agents listen to,
generate and evaluate each other's music themes based on their creativity performance.

## Introduction

Creative music generation is not trivial, since it involves very deep understanding of the laws that make music valuable (or bearable) and
at the same time to be novel. In this approach, we are just focusing on creative theme (or melody) generation. Check the glossary for
general musical terms.

## Glossary

Some useful word definitions to understand some the terminology used here:

*note: note can have different meanings according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_(music)), but we are using this 
one: "A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound". It is used interchangeably with "tone" here.
*duration: property of a note: the amount of time that it takes to play it.
*pitch: degree of highness or lowess of a note (like C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
