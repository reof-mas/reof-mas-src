# reof-mas-src
Reof-mas is an environment written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") where different agents listen to,
generate and evaluate each other's music themes based on their creativity performance.

## Introduction

Creative music generation is not trivial, since it involves very deep understanding of the laws that make music valuable (or bearable) and
at the same time to be novel. In this approach, we are just focusing on creative theme generation. Check the glossary for
general musical terms.

## Glossary

Useful word definitions to understand some the terminology used here.

* __note:__ note can have different meanings according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_(music)), but we are using this one: "A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound". It is used interchangeably with __tone__ here.
* __duration:__ property of a note: the amount of time that it takes to play it.
* __pitch:__ degree of highness or lowess of a note (like C, D, E, F, G, A, B). In physics, it is the frequency of a sound. [_from wikipedia:_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)): "Pitch can be determined only in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise"
* __theme__ [_(based on wikipedia)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(music)): The material, usually a recognizable melody, upon which part or all of a composition is based. A theme can be seen as the combination and transformation of one or several motifs.
* __motif__ [_(based on wikipedia)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)): a short sucession of notes that is the smallest analyzable element or phrase within a theme.
